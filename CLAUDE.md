## Deployment Guidelines

- No testing to the local host, if there is a new version of the site, validate the build locally to make sure there aren't any errors, if there are fix them, then push the code to our git repo and force a deployment to Vercel using this url https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/prj_0NGYROVTIxjQwNtddl8liAvIsoUn/ABZPfLLnMk
